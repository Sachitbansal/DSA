2. `php html css javascript created:2013-01-01..2015-12-31`

### Verification Criteria Applied:
- ✅ Repository created between 2013-2015
- ✅ Contains PHP code
- ✅ Has both frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and backend (PHP) components
- ✅ Appears to be a complete application, not just a library

### Key Findings:

   - Laravel 5.2 was released in December 2015
   - This causes many false positives in the search

   - Most developers had moved to PHP 5.3+ by 2013
   - PHP 5.2 reached end of life in 2011

3. **Complete web applications from this era exist**

   - E-commerce and social networking platforms

4. **Common characteristics:**
   - Simple MVC or procedural structure
   - Direct MySQL connections (not mysqli/PDO)
   - jQuery for frontend interactivity
   - Bootstrap for styling
